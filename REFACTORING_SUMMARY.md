## Testing Recommendations

After this refactoring, it's recommended to:
1. Run the existing test suite to ensure no functionality was broken
2. Add unit tests for the new private methods
3. Test the authentication flow thoroughly
4. Verify all API endpoints work correctly
5. Test the contact form functionality

## Conclusion

The refactoring has significantly improved the codebase quality, maintainability, and readability. All files now follow consistent patterns and include comprehensive documentation. The code is more robust, secure, and easier to maintain.

The application should continue to function exactly as before, but with much cleaner and more maintainable code.
